## Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Information Gathering (REQUIRED FIRST)
```markdown
Before attempting any fixes, run these diagnostic steps:

1. **Security & Access Control**
   - [ ] Run security scan: `security--run_security_scan`
   - [ ] Check RLS policies: `supabase--linter`
   - [ ] Verify user permissions and data access

2. **Database Integrity** 
   - [ ] Schema analysis: `security--get_table_schema`
   - [ ] Check constraints and triggers
   - [ ] Validate data relationships

3. **Authentication State**
   - [ ] Debug overlay analysis (check user session, phone status)
   - [ ] Auth diagnostic tests
   - [ ] Profile linking verification

4. **System Logs & Monitoring**
   - [ ] Console logs: `lov-read-console-logs`
   - [ ] Network requests: `lov-read-network-requests` 
   - [ ] Function logs (if applicable)

5. **Current State Documentation**
   - [ ] Reproduce the exact error
   - [ ] Document expected vs actual behavior
   - [ ] Identify affected user flows
```

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
```markdown
Analyze findings to identify:

- **Immediate Cause**: What specific code/config is failing?
- **Contributing Factors**: What conditions enable this failure?
- **Root Cause**: What fundamental issue allows this to happen?
- **Systemic Impact**: What other areas might be affected?
```

### Phase 3: Solution Strategy
```markdown
Design solution approach:

- **Fix Strategy**: Address root cause, not just symptoms
- **Security Impact**: How does this change affect access control?
- **Data Integrity**: Will this maintain data consistency?
- **User Experience**: Does this improve or maintain UX?
- **Testing Plan**: How to verify the fix works completely?
```
